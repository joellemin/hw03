a README.md file, properly formatted with markdown syntax, that:
clearly states which candidate your bot is supporting or opposing.
provides a link to your favorite thread involving your bot, an image screenshot of the thread, and a short description of what you like about it. (Below each comment is a button labeled permalink that lets you link to a comment.)
includes the output of running the bot_counter.py file on your bot to count how many comments you've created; the output of this command must be inside of a markdown code block (i.e. use the triple backticks notation)
explains what you believe your score should be (clearly state which tasks you complete/don't complete).
